Privacy Policy – Paperly (PDF Reader & Maker)
Effective date: August 24, 2025

Paperly is a mobile application that lets you read PDFs, create PDFs from images, edit images (crop/rotate/annotate), and manage recent files. We designed Paperly so your documents stay on your device. This page explains what data we (and our partners) may process and your choices.

1) What we do not collect
No account or login is required.
We do not upload your PDFs, images, or edits to our servers. Processing happens on your device.
We do not collect your contacts, calendar, precise location, or microphone/camera data.
2) Data we may process
Paperly itself processes only what is necessary to provide features on your device. Our advertising partner (Google AdMob) may collect certain data for ads and fraud prevention.

On-device files you select (PDFs, images) are accessed locally to open, edit, create, or share PDFs. These files remain on your device unless you choose to share them.
Preferences (e.g., reader/view settings, recent items) are stored locally on your device.
Ads data (via Google AdMob SDK) may include device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), IP address (which may infer approximate location), app interactions, and diagnostic data for ad delivery and abuse prevention. See “Third-party services” below.
3) How we use data
Provide core features: open/view PDFs, convert images to PDF, annotate, and share files you choose.
Remember your preferences and recent files locally.
Show advertising to keep the app free (through Google AdMob).
4) Third‑party services
We integrate the following third‑party SDKs. Their processing is governed by their own policies:

Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK) – advertising and fraud prevention.
Policy: Google Privacy Policy · SDK policy: AdMob data disclosure
Android system components – Storage Access Framework (file picker), system share sheet, and print framework. These run on-device and do not send your files to Paperly servers.
Syncfusion PDF Viewer – used for rendering PDFs on-device. We do not send your documents to Syncfusion servers.
5) Permissions
Storage / Photos and media – to open images and PDFs you select and to save exported PDFs.
Internet – to load ads from AdMob and optional links (support/rate).
Network state – for reliable ad loading.
You can revoke permissions anytime in your device Settings. Paperly works with the Android Storage Access Framework so you stay in control of file access.

6) Legal bases (EEA/UK users)
Contract/Legitimate interests – to provide app features you request.
Consent – for personalized advertising where required by law. You can turn off ad personalization in your device Google settings or via Ad choices where available.
7) Children’s privacy
Paperly is not directed to children under 13 (or the age defined by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

8) Data retention
On‑device files and preferences remain until you delete them or uninstall the app.
Ad data retention is controlled by Google. See Google’s policy for details.
9) Your choices
Reset or remove your device advertising ID and turn off ad personalization in Android Settings.
Use system permission controls to limit file access.
Uninstall the app to remove local preferences and cached data.
10) Security
We aim to minimize data collection. Files remain on your device unless you share them. We rely on platform security features and reputable SDKs.

11) International transfers
Third‑party partners like Google may process data on servers worldwide. See their policies for the applicable safeguards.

12) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when changes are made.
